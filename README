## Description
My motivation was to be get better at reorganizing structure of HTML and CSS documents.
This project was built for practice to be ready for future arisements.
The problem solved from original file was the reoccurrence of Divitis. There was no semantic structure, which makes it hard for other developers or SEO to make accessible to viewers or audience.
I learned to go about condensing things in sections and learned to proof test on new files to keep track of changes and arrangements without disrrupting webpage flow.
